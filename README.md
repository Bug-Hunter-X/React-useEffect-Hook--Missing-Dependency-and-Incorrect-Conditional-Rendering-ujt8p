# React useEffect Hook Bug: Missing Dependency and Incorrect Conditional Logic

This repository demonstrates a common React bug involving the `useEffect` hook: a missing dependency and incorrect conditional rendering logic.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` component uses the `useEffect` hook to log a message when the `count` state variable exceeds 5. However, there's a crucial dependency missing in the `useEffect` hook's dependency array (`[count]`).  Additionally, the conditional rendering logic inside the `useEffect` is not handled correctly, potentially leading to unintended side effects and making debugging challenging.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe the console output and the component's behavior.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves:

- Adding the missing dependency `someProp` to the `useEffect` hook's dependency array.
- Refactoring the conditional rendering logic to handle cases where `someProp` is undefined or null.
- Adjusting the logic to correctly handle conditional rendering within the component.

The solution ensures that the effect only runs when necessary, preventing unexpected behavior and enhancing code maintainability.
